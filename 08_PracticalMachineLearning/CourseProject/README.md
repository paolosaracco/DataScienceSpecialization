# Course Project

This repository stores scripts and files about the course project for the Regression Models course in the Data Science Specialization offered by JHU on Coursera. Additional details about the project and the data involved can be found in the Markdown file [Regression_project.md](Regression_project.md).

The instructions for the project read: *You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:*

- *"Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?"*
- *"Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"*
