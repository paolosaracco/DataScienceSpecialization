# Data Analysis Practice

I accepted to participate in a research experiment with the purpose of better understanding how people analyze data. This quiz involved a short data analysis that gave me a chance to practice the regression concepts I have learned so far. 

Since the authors asked that I do not share information about this quiz to maintain the integrity of this experiment, I will not provide any further detail apart from those included in the file "college_major_analysis.rds".
