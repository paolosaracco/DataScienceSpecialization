# Course Project 1

This repository stores scripts and files about the first course project for the Reproducible Research course in the Data Science Specialization offered by JHU on Coursera.

Following the instructions for the project, I forked a GitHub repository, made it mine and pushed my scripts there. The file [ProjectInstructions.md](ProjectInstructions.md) contains the given instructions for the project and the details about the dataset used to generate the plots.
